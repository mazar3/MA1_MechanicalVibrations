For the oral examination, you will need to : 
* Prepare a 10 min presentation (10 slides max), which you need to submit by email (Arnaud.Deraemaeker@ulb.be) before the deadline of January 18, midnight. Please name your file according to the following standard: LastName_FirstName_MV2026.ppt (.pdf, …), for example Deraemaeker_Arnaud_MV2026.pptx.
* It will be followed by 5 min of questions (15 min oral examination). There is no need to reexplain what the project is about in the slides, you should only present the answers to the questions. You will not be allowed to modify your presentation after the deadline, and must present orally what you have submitted (the presentation will be projected on a large screen, not on your own laptop or tablet). If you have noticed after the deadline that there is an error in the presentation, just mention it during the presentation.
* Submit your jupyter notebook with the answers to the different questions (also deadline January 18, midnight). The professor might ask you questions about your code and the notebook must work and produce the same results as the ones you put in your presentation.
