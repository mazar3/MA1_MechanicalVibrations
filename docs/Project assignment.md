Dear students,

The project is available on JupyterHub. As explained in the introduction of the course, this project will be evaluated as part of the oral examination and is worth 40% of the final grade of the course. You will find below the details and deadlines for submitting your project and presenting it, as well as how to proceed with the notebook.

The workload associated with the project is 1 ECTS (12h in class) but as there are no dedicated time slots in the schedule, you are expected to work from home on Jupyterhub. We will organize a few on-line sessions (the schedule will be communicated soon) to answer your questions.

Instructions for JupyterHub

The project is available on JupyterHub. You will need to complete the cells below each question. Each assignment comes with two empty cells for your answers. You can add more cells if needed.

Please note that there are no assertions to verify the correctness of your answers. A successful validation does not necessarily mean your answer is correct.

After finishing the assignment  as is, you can validate and submit. Don't clear your notebook ahead of submission.

Instructions for the oral examination

 For the oral examination, you will need to

• Prepare a 10 min presentation (10 slides max), which you need to submit by email (Arnaud.Deraemaeker@ulb.be) before the deadline of January 18, midnight. Please name your file according to the following standard: LastName_FirstName_MV2026.ppt (.pdf, …), for example Deraemaeker_Arnaud_MV2026.pptx. 

• It will be followed by 5 min of questions (15 min oral examination). There is no need to reexplain what the project is about in the slides, you should only present the answers to the questions. You will not be allowed to modify your presentation after the deadline, and must present orally what you have submitted (the presentation will be projected on a large screen, not on your own laptop or tablet). If you have noticed after the deadline that there is an error in the presentation, just mention it during the presentation.

• Submit your jupyter notebook with the answers to the different questions (also deadline January 18, midnight). The professor might ask you questions about your code and the notebook must work and produce the same results as the ones you put in your presentation.
